# TaPformer

## Approach

To ensure a fair comparison of methods across different domains, we adopt various experimental frameworks for evaluation.  

**Traffic Flow Prediction:**  
- For the LargeST series datasets, we follow the original authors' publicly available code [LargeST](https://github.com/liuxu77/LargeST) as the experimental baseline.  

## Reproduction

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Run the following script to reproduce the experiments:
   ```bash
   ./run.sh

3. Experimental logs and trained weights are stored in the experiments/ directory under the corresponding subfolders.
